# Training on mnist dataset using Keras API
This is a simple implementation of a feedforward neural network using using Tensorflow framework on a mnist dataset, which is essentially a dataset of images with handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
It has four fully connected hidden layers with ReLU activation  and linear activation in the output layer.
I used Adagrad optimizer with learning rate of 0.005.
